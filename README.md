# 5-Sobel-and-Previtt
Sobel Operator
The Sobel operator is an edge detection technique used in image processing to compute the gradient of image intensity at each pixel. It uses two 3x3 convolution kernels to detect horizontal and vertical edges, making it effective for highlighting significant intensity changes in an image.

Prewitt Operator
The Prewitt operator is an edge detection method similar to the Sobel operator. It also uses convolution with two 3x3 kernels to detect edges in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It is particularly useful for detecting edges in images with noise reduction capabilities.

5-1 -->Sobel Edge Detection with OpenCV
This Python script demonstrates the application of the Sobel operator for edge detection in an image. The Sobel operator calculates the gradient of the image intensity in both the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) directions to highlight the edges of objects in the image.
